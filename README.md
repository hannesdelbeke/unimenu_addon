# Unimenu Blender Add-on

A Blender add-on wrapper for UniMenu, the config menu-customiser.<br>
This add-on is a self contained environment to quickly get started with UniMenu. <br>
So you don't have to setup your own environment in a startup file, something you'd likely want to do in a studio pipeline.

## Install
- install addon
- install dependencies (unimenu)
